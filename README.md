## Linux on KooTigers Mini Pc
Almost everything worked out of the box. Touch Screen and screen rotation both didnt work.
Touch screen now works perfectly, screen rotation is sketchy. I dont use it so I turned it off in Gnome, and not a concern in Hyprland.

**How to fix:**
Just run the script or from inside ./arch-mini-mod.sh hit "Apply KooTigers Touchscreen Driver".
After just reboot and you're ready to go.

Check the [README](https://github.com/Piercingxx/arch-mini-mod/blob/main/resources/KooTigers-drivers/README.md) for more information.




## Linux on NuVision 8" Tablet TM800W610L
Wi-Fi and bluetooth drivers are not found in linux kernel by default. I ripped the wifi driver out of the windows install but the bluetooth driver was a royal pain. Had to rebuild it from binary...4 hours of my life gone.
    - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth both work perfectly now.

Audio is also non-functional out of the box.

Screen orientation is rotated 90° on Debian GNOME and Plasma, and does not auto-rotate on Arch until you install the Wi-Fi driver.

**How to fix:**

Just run the `nuvision-tablet-drivers.sh` script. This script is also included in the whiptail menu of the main `arch-mini-mod.sh` installer.

Check the [README](https://github.com/Piercingxx/arch-mini-mod/blob/main/resources/NuVision-8in-tablet/README.md) for more information.
